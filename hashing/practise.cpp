/*
242 -> Anagram 
the core concept that i understand from the problem is to check the number of the frequency of the letter in the word which is 
in the string t and s. if the frequency of the letter in the word are same the the both string can make a anagram.
so first we need to find the frequency of the letter in the string s and the same we need to that in the the string t as well 
and then we need to compare the frequency if it comes same then the two string will be doing anagram.
